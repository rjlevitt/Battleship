# Battleship in C++

This was a capstone project for an introductory computer science course. The purpose of the assignment was to introduce some basic operations in C++. The project required the inclusion of the following concepts: 

1. Inputs and Output (I/O)
2. Variables
3. Arrays
4. File I/O
5. Iteration (loops)
6. Interaction
7. Control

The code in the capstone folder is a mini version of battleship. A user plays a computer by placing a ship on their board, and alterantes guessing where the computer's ship is located. The first plater to sink the other person's ship wins.
